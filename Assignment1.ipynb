    "Ans:- class is one of the OOPS concept. Class is defined by keyword 'class' in python. Class is blueprint which contain paramenter / attributes and funtions writen in it. This attributes and funtions describe behaviour of class. A class allows code reusability, modularity, and organization in object-oriented programming. \n",
